#Material Design address book
This is an example of a simple CRUD address book. 

*Currently Javascript is not added. motion and onclick action are simulated via CSS*

This outlines a 3 view card for each contact. 
The firt card (top left) is a static example of what each contact card looks like when viewing the contact list. 

The second card *currently on hover* Shows the second state of interaction, in this case it shows the contact details again, with the option to edit the information

The third card is the *edit* state, after a user has clicked on the edit button in stage (card) 2.
Here, the user is able to add basic information including twitter handle, which could be what populates the user image when one is not provided. Because really, who has their own images of their contacts?
	The Form fields have basic interaction 

##feature roadmap
Add group lists to quickly sort through friends, business contacts, and everyone else. 
Add a search filter to quickly type in someones name to access their information

Add javascript to have proper interactions and motion.
